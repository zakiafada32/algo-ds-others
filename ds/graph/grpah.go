- graph
	- directed graph
		- cyclic graph or not allow
		- weighted graph or unweighted
		- search for other implementation
	- undirected graph -> bidirectional
		- search for other implementation

	- graph has alot of implementation

- represent graph
	- adjacency list
		- less space
		- faster add or remove vertex
		- slow add or remove edge
	- adjacency matrix
		- faster lookup
		- slow add or remove vertex -> copy all value into new matrix
		- faster add or remove edge
